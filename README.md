# TrollPluginGilan
A troll plugin with some troll commands.

Stuff to be added - 
 - Make it so /box and /boxtotal store the blocks to a config so you can clear the blocks with a command later
 - Make it so instead of /creeper it is /mob and it takes 2 args: player-name and mob-type
 - Make it so /box and /boxtotal is customizable through a config that control the block-type
